# SQL-and-Bash-number-guessing-game
This is a project where I used SQL and bash to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal. The SQL portion is used to create a database that stores the user's name, play history, and their best game. The bash portion involves a function to that produces a random number, take the user's number guess, and says if the actual number is higher or lower.
